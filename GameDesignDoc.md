## THUGS
The enemies in my game include 5 different types of thugs.

### Bulldozer

The Bulldozer simply runs across the screen in a single direction, speeding up as he goes. If he hits the player, the player will lose health.

### Blade

The Blade will jump in on either side of the game window, coming and going at random, and throw knives at the player. The knives will inflict damage.

### Boxer
![alt text](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B1BPxtqj8Cl5RnJZcFEzcEtxVGs/edit?usp=sharing "Boxer")
The Boxer will walk across the screen more slowly, punching anything in front of him. He will move at a constant speed and hurt the player if he hits them.

### Jumper

The Jumper will jump up and down across the screen, hurting the player if he hits them.

### Creep
![alt text](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B1BPxtqj8Cl5a3FCNVpfdXBxbnM/edit?usp=sharing "Creep")
The Creep will randomly drop down from the ceiling in an attempt to land on the user. If he lands on them, damage will be inflicted.

## THE HERO
### Magic Ninja
![alt text](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B1BPxtqj8Cl5U3RHZ2tNSW9TalE/edit?usp=sharing "Magic Ninja")
This ninja is the player's character. He is able to run and jump to dodge enemy attacks. Also, he will be able to shoot projectiles. He may even have the ability
to become invisible or to slow down time.
