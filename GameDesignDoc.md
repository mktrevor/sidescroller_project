## THUGS
The enemies in my game include 5 different types of thugs. They all look like strong, evil villains. Pictures are included below.

### Bulldozer

The Bulldozer simply runs across the screen in a single direction, speeding up as he goes. If he hits the player, the player will lose health.

### Blade

The Blade will jump in on either side of the game window, coming and going at random, and throw knives at the player. The knives will inflict damage.

### Boxer

The Boxer will walk across the screen more slowly, punching anything in front of him. He will move at a constant speed and hurt the player if he hits them.

### Jumper

The Jumper will jump up and down across the screen, hurting the player if he lands on top of them.

### Creep

The Creep will randomly drop down from the ceiling in an attempt to land on the user. If he lands on them, damage will be inflicted.

## THE HERO
### Magic Ninja

This ninja is the player's character. He is able to run and jump to dodge enemy attacks. Also, he will be able to shoot projectiles. He may even have the ability
to become invisible or to slow down time. The projectiles will be able to eliminate the enemies, depending on how strong they are.

## CONTROLS
### Keyboard
Movement will be controlled with the keyboard. The WASD keys will be used for movement, and the spacebar will be used to shoot projectiles.

### Mouse
The mouse buttons will be used for extra abilities, such as becoming invisible or slowing down time.

## SCORING
The score will go up faster and faster depending on how long the player survives. The score cannot go down. The score will also increase when the player
eliminates enemies.

## LIVES
The player will have multiple lives to start with(probably 3). They will also have a health bar that goes down as they are injured. When the health bar is depleted,
the player will lose one life, and the health bar will be regenerated. When all of the player's lives are lost, the player will "die" for good and the game will be
 over. There may be rare opportunities to pick up extra lives during the game.

## LAYOUT
The layout of the game will be very basic with only a few buttons and display boxes. Most of the window will be used to display the game itself.
### Buttons
Start and quit buttons will be used to start new games and quit the program. An options button will have difficulty options among other things. A pause button
will pause the game, which will also happen if the user presses 'p'.

### Text
The top of the game window will prominently display the game's title. In the top right corner, the user's score and name will be displayed. Below that, the level 
and number of lives will also be visible. There will also be a health bar to keep track of health.

### Gameplay
The actual gameplay will be displayed below the menus and other display boxes. It will take up most of the game window and have room for many enemies and
lots of moving around.
