## THUGS
The enemies in my game include 5 different types of thugs. They all look like strong, evil villains. Pictures are included below.

### Bulldozer

The Bulldozer simply runs across the screen in a single direction very quickly. If he hits the player, the player will lose health.

### Blade

The Blade will jump in on either side of the game window, coming and going at random, and throw knives at the player. The knives will inflict damage.

### Boxer

The Boxer will walk across the screen more slowly, randomly changing direction. He will move at a constant speed and hurt the player if he hits them.

### Jumper

The Jumper will jump up and down across the screen, hurting the player if he lands on top of them.

### Creep

The Creep will randomly drop down from the ceiling in an attempt to land on the user. If he lands on them or touches them otherwise, damage will be inflicted.

## THE HERO
### Magic Ninja

This ninja is the player's character. He is able to run and jump to dodge enemy attacks. Also, he will be able to shoot fireballs.
The fireballs will be able to eliminate the enemies, with more shots needed to kill stronger enemies.

## CONTROLS
### Keyboard
Movement will be controlled with the keyboard. The WASD keys will be used for moving left/right and jumping.
The arrow keys will be used to shoot fireballs in any direction.

## SCORING
The score will go up faster and faster depending on how long the player survives. The score cannot go down. The score will also increase when the player
eliminates enemies.

## LIVES
The player will have 3 lives to start with. They will also have 100 health points that go down as they are injured. When the player's health is depleted,
the player will lose one life, and their health will be regenerated. When all of the player's lives are lost, the player will "die" for good and the game will be
 over.

## LAYOUT
The layout of the game will be very basic with only a few buttons and display boxes. Most of the window will be used to display the game itself.
### Buttons
Start and quit buttons will be used to start new games and quit the program. The start and quit functions will also run if the player presses 'F1'
or 'Esc', respectively. A pause button will pause the game, which will also happen if the user presses 'p'.

### Text
The game window title will display the game's title. There will be a top toolbar that includes the Start/Quit/Pause buttons.
Below that, there will be a bar that displays the player's name, lives, health, and score. These will all update in real time as the game runs.

### Gameplay
The actual gameplay will be displayed below the menus and other display boxes. It will take up most of the game window and have room for many enemies and
lots of moving around. It will also speed up considerably as time goes on.

### Concept (Subject to change)
