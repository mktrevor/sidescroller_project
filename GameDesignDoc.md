## THUGS
The enemies in my game include 5 different types of thugs. They all look like strong, evil villains. Pictures are included below.

### Bulldozer

The Bulldozer simply runs across the screen in a single direction, speeding up as he goes. If he hits the player, the player will lose health.

### Blade

The Blade will jump in on either side of the game window, coming and going at random, and throw knives at the player. The knives will inflict damage.

### Boxer

The Boxer will walk across the screen more slowly, punching anything in front of him. He will move at a constant speed and hurt the player if he hits them.

### Jumper

The Jumper will jump up and down across the screen, hurting the player if he hits them.

### Creep

The Creep will randomly drop down from the ceiling in an attempt to land on the user. If he lands on them, damage will be inflicted.

## THE HERO
### Magic Ninja

This ninja is the player's character. He is able to run and jump to dodge enemy attacks. Also, he will be able to shoot projectiles. He may even have the ability
to become invisible or to slow down time.

## CONTROLS
### Keyboard
Movement will be controlled with the keyboard. The WASD keys will be used for movement, and the spacebar will be used to shoot projectiles.

### Mouse
The mouse will be used for extra abilities, such as becoming invisible or slowing down time.

## SCORING
The score will go up faster and faster depending on how long the player survives. The score cannot go down. The score will also increase when the player
eliminates enemies.

## LIVES
The player will have multiple lives to start with(probably 3). They will also have a health bar that goes down as they are injured. When the health bar is depleted,
the player will lose one life. When all three lives are lost, the player will "die" for good and the game will be over. There may be rare opportunities to pick up
extra lives during the game.
